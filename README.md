PHP-CPP
=======

The PHP-CPP library is a C++ library for developing PHP extensions. It offers a collection
of well documented and easy-to-use classes that can be used and extended to build native
extensions for PHP.

This library makes it much easier to build PHP extensions. Extensions developed with
PHP-CPP are easier to understand and simpler to maintain, because the code looks
much more straightforward than code of extensions written in C.

This library is currently a work in progress, and can not yet be used to build real extensions.
You can however keep an eye on the progress we're making.

PHP-CPP is an initiative from Copernica BV.
