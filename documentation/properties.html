<h1>Class properties</h1>
<p>
    When you define a class completely in PHP, you can add properties (member 
    variables) to it. When you add member variables to a native C++ class however, 
    you better use regular C++ member variables for that, instead of PHP variables.
    Native variables have an immensely better performance than PHP variables,
    and it would be insane to store integers or strings in Php::Value objects
    if you can store them in int's and std::string objects as well.
</p>
<p>
    To access these member variables you could create getX() and setX()
    methods, or alternatively implement __get() and __set() methods if you 
    want to make your native member variables look like public or protected 
    properties.
</p>
<p>
    I can not imagine that there is anyone in the world who would like to create
    a native class, with regular public PHP properties on it. But still, in this 
    article we explain how you can do that.
