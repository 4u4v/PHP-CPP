<h2>Working with variables</h2>
<p>
    Variables in PHP are non-typed. A variable can thus hold any possible type:
    an integer, string, a floating point number, and even an object or an array.
    C++ on the other hand is a typed language. In C++ an integer variable always 
    has a numeric value, and a string variable always hold a string value.
</p>
<p>
    When you mix native code and PHP code, you will need to convert the non-typed 
    PHP variables into native variables, and the other way round: convert native 
    variables back into non-typed PHP variables. The PHP-CPP library offers the 
    "Value" class that makes this a very simple task.
