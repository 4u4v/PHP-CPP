<h1>Working with variables</h1>
<p>
    Variables in PHP are non-typed. A variable can thus hold any possible type:
    an integer, string, a floating point number, and even an object or an array.
    C++ on the other hand is a typed language. In C++ an integer variable always 
    has a numeric value, and a string variable always hold a string value.
</p>
<p>
    When you mix native code and PHP code, you will need to convert the non-typed 
    PHP variables into native variables, and the other way round: convert native 
    variables back into non-typed PHP variables. The PHP-CPP library offers the 
    Php::Value class that makes this a very simple task.
</p>
<h2>Zval's</h2>
<p>
    But we start with sharing one of our frustrations. 
    If you have ever spent time on writing PHP extensions in plain C, or if you've
    ever read something about the internals of PHP, you must have heard about zval's.
    A zval is a C structure in which PHP variables are stored. Internally, this zval
    keeps a refcount, a union with the possible types and a number of other members
    too. Every time that you access such a zval, make a copy of it, or write to
    it, you must break your head to correctly update the refcount, and/or split the 
    zval into different zvals, explicitly call copy constructors, allocate or 
    free memory (using special memory allocation routines), or choose not to 
    do this and leave the zval alone.
</p>
<p>
    This all is crazy difficult and a big source for mistakes and all sorts of bugs.
</p>
<p>
    And to make things even worse, there are literally hundreds of different 
    undocumented (!) macro's and functions in the Zend engine that can manipulate these 
    zval variables. There are special macro's that work on zval's, macro's for 
    pointers-to-zval's, macro's for pointer-to-pointer-to-zval's and even macro's 
    that deal with pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer-to-zval's.
</p>
<p>
    Every single PHP module, every PHP extension, and every builtin PHP function
    is busy manipulating these zval structures. It is a big surprise that nobody
    ever took the time to wrap such a zval in a simple C++ class that does all 
    this administration for you. C++ is such a nice language with constructors, 
    destructors, casting operators and operator overloading that can encapsulate all
    this complicated zval handling.
</p>
<p>
    And that is exactly what we did with PHP-CPP. We have introduced the Php::Value
    object with a very simple interface, that takes away all the problems of zval 
    handling. Internally, the Php::Value object is a wrapper around a zval variable, 
    but it completely hides the complexity of zval handling.
</p>
<p>
    So, everything that you always wanted to ask about the internals of PHP, but
    were afraid to ask: just forget about it. Sit back and relax, and take a look
    how simple life is with PHP-CPP.
</p>
<h2>Scalar variables</h2>
<p>
    The Php::Value object can be used to store scalar variables. Scalar variables
    are variables like integers, doubles, strings, booleans and null values.
    To create such a scalar variable, just assign it to a Php::Value object.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
Php::Value value1 = 1234;
Php::Value value2 = "this is a string";
Php::Value value3 = std::string("another string");
Php::Value value4 = nullptr;
Php::Value value5 = 123.45;
Php::Value value6 = true;
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    The Php::Value class has casting operators to cast the object to almost
    every thinkable native type. When you have access to a Php::Value object,
    but want to store it in a (much faster) native variable, you can simply
    assign it.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
void myFunction(const Php::Value &amp;value)
{
    int value1 = value;
    std::string value2 = value;
    double value3 = value;
    bool value4 = value;
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    If the Php::Value object holds an object, and you cast it to a string, the
    __toString() method of the object gets called, exactly what would happen
    if you had casted the variable to a string in a PHP script.
</p>
<p>
    Many different operators are overloaded too so that you can use a Php::Value
    object directly in arithmetric operations, compare it with other variables,
    or send it to an output stream.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
void myFunction(Php::Value &amp;value)
{
    value += 10;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    if (value == "some string")
    {
        
    }
    
    int result = value - 8;
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    The Php::Value object has implicit constructors for most types. This means
    that every function that accepts a Php::Value as parameter can also be
    called with a native type, and in functions that should return a Php::Value
    you can simply specify a scalar return value - which will automatically be
    converted into a Php::Value object by the compiler.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
Php::Value myFunction(const Php::Value &amp;value)
{
    if (value == 12)
    {
        return "abc";
    }
    else if (value > 100)
    {
        return myFunction(12);
    }
    
    return nullptr;
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    As you can see in the examples, you can do almost anything with Php::Value
    objects. Internally it does all the zval manipulation, and sometimes that
    can become complicated, but for you, the extension programmer, there is
    nothing to worry about.
</p>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
    PHP supports two array types: regular arrays (indexed by numbers) and
    associative arrays (indexed by strings). The Php::Value object supports
    arrays too. By using array access operators (square brackets) to assign
    values to a Php::Value object, you automatically turn it into an array.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
// create a regular array
Php::Value array;
array[0] = "apple";
array[1] = "banana";
array[2] = "tomato";

// create an associative array
Php::Value assoc;
assoc["apple"] = "green";
assoc["banana"] = "yellow";
assoc["tomato"] = "green";

// array values do not all have to be of the same type
Php::Value assoc2;
assoc2["x"] = "info@example.com";
assoc2["y"] = nullptr;
assoc2["z"] = 123;

// nested arrays are possible too
Php::Value assoc2;
assoc2["x"] = "info@example.com";
assoc2["y"] = nullptr;
assoc2["z"][0] = "a";
assoc2["z"][1] = "b";
assoc2["z"][2] = "c";
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    Reading from arrays is just as simple. You can use the array access 
    operators (square brackets) for this too.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
Php::Value array;
array["x"] = 10;
array["y"] = 20;

std::cout &lt;&lt; array["x"] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; array["y"] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    There also is a special Php::Array class. This is an extended Php::Value
    class that, when constructed, immediately starts as empty array (unlike
    Php::Value objects that by default construct to NULL values).
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
// create empty array
Php::Array array1;

// Php::Value is the base class, so you can assign Php::Array objects
Php::Value array2 = array1;

// impossible, a Php::Array must always be an array
array1 = 100;
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    @todo explain how to iterate over arrays
</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>
    Just like the Php::Array class that is an extended Php::Value that initializes
    to an empty array, there also is a Php::Object class that becomes an
    object when constructed. By default this is an instance of stdClass - PHP's
    most simple class.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
// create empty object of type stdClass
Php::Object object;

// Php::Value is the base class, so you can assign Php::Object objects
Php::Value value = object;

// impossible, a Php::Object must always be an object
object = "test";

// object properties can be accessed with square brackets
object["property1"] = "value1";
object["property2"] = "value2";

// to create an object of a different type, pass in the class name 
// to the constructor with optional constructor parameters
object = Php::Object("DateTime", "now");

// methods can be called with the call() method
std::cout &lt;&lt; object.call("format", "Y-m-d H:i:s") &lt;&lt; std::endl;

// all these methods can be called on a Php::Value object too
Php::Value value = Php::Object("DateTime", "now");
std::cout &lt;&lt; value.call("format", "Y-m-d H:i:s") &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>
    When a Php::Value holds a <i>callable</i>, you can use the () operator
    to call this function or method.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-c++"><code>
// create a string with a function name
Php::Value date = "date";

// "date" is a builtin PHP function and thus can it be called
std::cout &lt;&lt; date("Y-m-d H:i:s") &lt;&lt; std::endl;

// create a date-time object
Php::Object now = Php::Object("DateTime","now");

// create an array with two members, the datetime object
// and the name of a method
Php::Array array();
array[0] = now;
array[1] = "format";

// an array with two members can be called too, the first
// member is seen as the object, and the second as the
// name of the method
std::cout &lt;&lt; array("Y-m-d H:i:s") &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>
</p>
