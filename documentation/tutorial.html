<h1>A PHP-CPP tutorial</h1>
<p>
    Building PHP extensions with the PHP-CPP library is not at all difficult - 
    in this tutorial we will give you step by step instructions to build
    your own extensions. However, before we start the actual programming, we will
    first explain how PHP interacts with its extensions - how extension libraries
    are loaded and how PHP knows which functions, constants and classes are
    defined by the extensions.
</p>
<h2>How does PHP load its extensions?</h2>
<p>
    You probably already know that native PHP extensions are compiled into *.so 
    files on unix-like systems, and *.dll files on Windows environments, and that
    the global php.ini file holds a list of all extensions available on your system.
    This means that if you're building your own extension, you will also need to
    create such a *.so or *.dll file and you will need to update the PHP 
    configuration so that your own extension is loaded by PHP.
</p>
<h3>Where to find your PHP configuration files?</h3>
<p>
    If for one reason or another you can not find the PHP configuration file(s) 
    on your system, you can run the following command from the command line:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        php --ini
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    This will output a list of all configuration files that are loaded by PHP.
    Extensions are enabled by adding "extension=name.so" lines to the
    configuration file - where 'name' should of course be replaced by the name of 
    your extension. A default PHP installation already comes with many default 
    extensions, so in the configuration file(s) on your system you will certainly 
    find a number of these "extension=name.so" lines.
</p>
<p>
    The extension lines either take an absolute path ("extension=/path/to/extension.so")
    or a relative path ("extension=extension.so"). If you'd like to use relative
    paths, you must make sure that you've copied your extension *.so file to the
    default extension directory, so that PHP can find it. To find out this default
    extension directory, use the following command line instruction:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        php -i|grep extension_dir
    </pre></code>
</p>
<h2>The get_module() startup function</h2>
<p>
    Before we explain how you can create your own extension however, we first explain
    what PHP does to load an extension. When PHP starts, it loads the configuration 
    file(s) that we just described and for each "extension=name.so" line in these
    files, it opens the appropriate library, and calls the "get_module()"
    function from it. Each extension library (your extension too) must therefore 
    define and implement this "get_module()" C function. The function is called by 
    PHP right after the library is loaded (and thus way before pageviews are handled), 
    and it should return a memory address that points to a structure that holds information 
    about all functions, classes, variables and constants that are made available 
    by the extension. 
</p>
<p>
    The structure that the get_module() returns is defined in the header files of 
    the Zend engine, but it is a pretty complicated structure without good documentation. 
    Luckily, the PHP-CPP library makes life easier for you, and offers an Extension 
    class that can be used instead.
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        #include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;
        
        extern "C" {
            PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() {
                static Php::Extension myExtension("my_extension", "1.0");
                return myExtension.module();
            }
        }
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    In the example above you see a very straightforward implementation of the
    get_module() function. Every PHP extension that uses the PHP-CPP library
    implements this function in a more or less similar way as the extension 
    starting point. A number of elements require special attention. For a 
    start, the only header file that you see is the phpcpp.h header
    file. If you're using the PHP-CPP library to build your own extensions,
    you do not have to include the complicated, unstructured, and mostly undocumented
    header files of the Zend engine - all you need is the single header file of
    the PHP-CPP library. If you insist, you are of course free to also include the header
    files of the core PHP engine - but you do not have to.
</p>
<p>
    The next thing that you'll notice it that we placed the get_module() function
    inside an 'extern "C"' code block. As the name of the library already gives away, 
    PHP-CPP is a C++ library. However, PHP expects your library, and especially your 
    get_module() function, to be implemented in C and not in C++. That's why we've 
    wrapped the get_module() function in an 'extern "C"' block. This will instruct 
    the C++ compiler that the get_module() is a regular C function, and
    no C++ name mangling should be applied to it.
</p>
<p>
    The PHP-CPP library defines a "PHPCPP_EXPORT" macro that should be placed
    in front of the get_module() function. This macro makes sure that the get_module()
    function is publicly exported, and thus callable by PHP. The macro has a different
    implementation based on the compiler and operating system.
</p>
<p>
    Inside the get_module() function the Extension object is instantiated, and the
    Extension::module() method is called. It is crucial that you make a <i>static</i>
    instance of this Extension class, because the object must exist for the entire
    lifetime of the PHP process, and not only for the duration of the get_module()
    call. The constructor takes two arguments: the name of your extension and 
    its version number. The Extension::module() method returns the memory address
    that PHP needs to initialize the library.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the example above does not yet export any native functions or 
    native classes to PHP - it only creates the extension. 
</p>
<h2>Exporting native functions</h2>
<p>
    An extension can of course only be useful if you define functions and/or 
    classes that can be accessed from PHP scripts. For functions you can do this 
    by adding your native function implementations to the Extension object:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        #include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;
        
        extern void example1();
        extern void example2(Php::Parameters &amp;params);
        extern Php::Value example3();
        extern Php::Value example4(Php::Parameters &amp;params);
        
        extern "C" {
            PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() {
                static Php::Extension myExtension("my_extension", "1.0");
                myExtension.add("native1", example1);
                myExtension.add("native2", example2);
                myExtension.add("native3", example3);
                myExtension.add("native4", example4);
                return myExtension.module();
            }
        }
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    What do we see here? We've added four function declarations ("example1", 
    "example2", "example3" and "example4") to the source code of our extension. 
    The reason why we've only declared the functions, and not fully implemented 
    them is to keep the example code relatively small. We assume that the 
    four example functions are implemented in a different file. In a real world 
    example you could just as well remove the "extern" keyword and implement the 
    four functions in the same source file as the get_module() call.
</p>
<p>
    The four functions all have a different signature: Some return a value, while
    others do not return anything. And some take parameters, while others do not.
    Despite the different signature of the functions, they can all be made
    available in PHP by adding them to the extension object, by simply calling
    the myExtension.add() method. This method takes two parameters: the name by
    which the function should be accessible in PHP, and the actual native
    function.
</p>
<p>
    In the example above we've used different names for the native functions
    ("example1" up to "example4") as for the PHP functions ("native1" to
    "native4"). This is legal - you do not have to use the same names for your
    native functions as for your PHP functions. The following PHP script can be 
    used to call the four native functions:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;?php
        native1();
        native2("a","b");
        $x = native3();
        $y = native4(1,2);
        ?&gt;
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    It is not possible to export every thinkable C/C++ function to the 
    PHP extension. Only functions that have one of the four supported signatures
    can be exported: functions that return
    void or a Php::Value object, and that either accept a Php::Parameters object
    or no parameters at all, can be added to the extension object and can thus
    be exported to PHP.
</p>
<h2>Parameter types</h2>
<p>
    PHP has a mechanism to enforce function parameters types, and to accept
    parameters either by reference or by value. In the examples above, we have
    not yet used that mechanism yes: it is up to the function implementations
    themselves to inspect the 'Parameters' object, and check if the
    variables are of the right type.
</p>
<p>
    However, the 'Extension::add()' method takes a third optional parameter that
    you can use to specify the number of parameters that are supported, whether
    the parameters are passed by reference or by value, and what the type of
    the parameters is:
</p>
<p>
    <code><pre>
        #include &lt;phpcpp.h&gt;
        
        extern void example(Php::Parameters &amp;params);
        
        extern "C" {
            PHPCPP_EXPORT void *get_module() {
                static Php::Extension myExtension("my_extension", "1.0");
                myExtension.add("example", example, {
                    Php::ByVal("a", Php::numericType),
                    Php::ByVal("b", "ExampleClass"),
                    Php::ByRef("c", "OtherClass")
                });
                return myExtension.module();
            }
        }
    </pre></code>
</p>
<p>
    Above you see that we pass in additional information when we register the         
    


    The Extension::add() method can be used to register native functions, and
    make them available in PHP. In the examples above, you've seen that the
    method takes two parameters: the name the function shou


<h2>Working with variables</h2>
<p>
    Variables in PHP are non-typed. A variable can thus hold any possible type:
    an integer, string, a floating point number, and even an object or an array.
    C++ on the other hand is a typed language. In C++ an integer variable always 
    has a numeric value, and a string variable always hold a string value.
</p>
<p>
    When you mix native code and PHP code, you will need to convert the non-typed 
    PHP variables into native variables, and the other way round: convert native 
    variables back into non-typed PHP variables. The PHP-CPP library offers the 
    "Value" class that makes this a very simple task.
