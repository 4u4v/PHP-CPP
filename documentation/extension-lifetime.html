<h1>The lifetime of an extension</h1>
<p>
    As we <a href="loading-extension">explained before</a>, the get_module()
    function is called when your extension is started. It returns a memory address 
    where the Zend engine can find all relevant information about your extension.
</p>
<p>
    After this get_module() call, your extension is loaded and will be used to handle
    <i>multiple</i> pageviews. This is an important difference between standard
    PHP scripts and native extensions, because standard PHP scripts handle only a single
    pageview. But extensions serve multiple pageviews after each other.
</p>
<p>
    This difference is especially important if you use global C++ variables. 
    Such global variables are initialized when the extension is loaded - and not at 
    the beginning of each pageview. Changes that you make to global variables keep 
    their value, and subsequent requests will therefore see this updated value. 
</p>
<p>
    This, by the way, only happens to <i>native</i> variables. Global PHP variables,
    stored in the Php::GLOBALS object, are re-initialized at the beginning of 
    each request. You do not have to worry about changes that you make to 
    global PHP variables: at the beginning of the next request, the Php::GLOBALS
    object is fresh and new, and the changes that you made during the
    previous request are no longer visible.
</p>
<p>
    Back to the global C++ variables. If you want to reset a global variable
    at the beginning of a new request, you can register a special callback function 
    that gets called in front of each request.
</p>

        // of each request

            // re-initialize the counter
            invokeDuringRequestCount = 0;
        });
        
        // add the updateCounter method to the extension
        extension.add("updateCounter", updateCounter);
        
        // return the extension details
        return extension;
    }
}</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    The Php::Extension class has a method onRequest() that is used in the
    above example to register a callback function. This callback is called right 
    before every pageview/request. As you can see in the example, it is 
    permitted to use lambda functions. In the above example the global variable
    invokeDuringRequestCount is re-initialized.
</p>
<p>
    The onRequest() is not the only callback that can be registered. There are
    four different callbacks on*() methods that you can call to register callbacks.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>onStartup(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>onRequest(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>onIdle(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
        <li>onShutdown(const std::function&lt;void()&gt; &callback);</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The startup callback is called when the Zend engine has loaded your extension 
    and all functions and classes in it were registered. If you want to initialize 
    additional variables in your extension before the functions are going to get called, 
    you can use the onStartup() function to register a callback to run this
    initialization code.
</p>
<p>
    After the extension is initialized, requests will be processed by it. In the
    example above we've used the onRequest() method to register a callback that is
    called in front of each request. There is also a callback that gets called
    <i>after</i> each request, when the extension moves to an idle state - waiting
    for the next request. This callback can be registered with the onIdle()
    method on the Php::Extension object.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth callback that you can register is a callback that gets called 
    right before PHP shuts down. If there is anything to clean up, you can install
    such a callback and run the cleanup code from it.
